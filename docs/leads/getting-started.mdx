# Getting Started

When you first open the Eaglescout app, you will be met with a homepage screen. Tap the "Sign Up" button to move on.

You can then create an account using a personal email. Note that every scouter will have their own email, so do not use a shared team email at this step.

Next, you will be asked to verify your email through a link sent to your inbox. Tap the link that was sent to you to verify your email. Note that it may take a few minutes for the email to arrive. If you don't see it, check your spam folder.

After verifying your email, you will be asked to enter your name, which will be displayed to other scouters and your scouting lead.

Finally, you will be asked to choose a team. Use the search feature to search for your team name or number.

Great job! You are now ready to move on to the next step: [Create a form for scouting and pit scouting](forms).
