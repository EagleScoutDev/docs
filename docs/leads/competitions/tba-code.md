# TBA Code

Go to [thebluealliance.com](https://www.thebluealliance.com/) and search for your competition using the search function on the top right of your screen.

Once you find and click on your competition, view the complete URL in your browser. It should have the format of:

```html
thebluealliance.com/event/**{event_code}**
```

The word after the last "/" is your TBA code. Copy this into the app when creating a competition.

### Example

For example, letâ€™s find the blue alliance code for the SFR 2024 Regional.

The url is: https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2024casf

Therefore, the TBA code is `2024casf`
