# Scouter Management

Each scouter on your team should set up their own account by following the instructions in the [For Scouters](../scouters/home) section. Once they have done that, you can manage them from the Scouter Management page.

## Approving Scouters

Each scouter that requests to join your team will show up in the "" section. Simply change their role from "Rejected" to "Scouter" or "Captain".
