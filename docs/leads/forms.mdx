# Forms

A form is a list of questions that a team asks during scouting.

A form can have an unlimited number of questions, and teams can choose which question type best represents the data that they want to collect.

### Types of Questions

**Text Input → Scouter can write anything they want in the text box**

3. Begin clicking the plus buttons to add questions to the form in whatever order you want.

### Sections

Sections are used to visually divide forms. Team 114 uses three different sections, **Auto**, **Teleop**, and **Post-Round**, but you can create as many as you want with whatever names you want.

Sections help scouters visually organize the data they need to collect.

To create a section, you must add a new question that is of type “Header” when creating a form. The questions underneath that header will show up within that section in the scouting form.
