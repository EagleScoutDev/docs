# Competitions

### Creating Competitions

Each competition you compete in should be created within the Data tab. To create a competition, click on the "Create
Competition" button. You will be prompted to enter the competition name, date, forms, and TBA code. Once you have
entered this information, press the "Submit" button to create the competition.

To get a competition's TBA code, refer to the instructions [here](tba-code).

### Modifying Competitions

To view and modify competitions, press the "Manage Competitions" button. You will be able to view all competitions you
have created, as well as edit or delete them. Note that you may only change the start and end time, but not the
competition's form. This is because any existing data submitted for the competition will be lost if the form is changed.
