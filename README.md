## What is EagleScout?

EagleScout is a next-generation scouting app for FRC, or First Robotics Competition. With its mobile-first approach, it is friendly to any device. In addition, it includes a full suite of aggregation features that will help you perfect your alliance strategy. EagleScout's customizable forms allow you to create forms with an in-app form editor, without waiting for an app update after the season starts!
